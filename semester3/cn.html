    <h4><b>Network</b></h4>
    <p>Network is a group of computers connected with each other through wires,optical fibres or optical links
      so that various devices can intract with each other through a network.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Networking</b></h4>
    <p>Computer networking refer to interconnected computing devices
      that can exchange data and share resources with each other.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Overview of Data Communication Networks</b></h3>
    <p>Communication is defined as a process in which more than computers
      transfers information, instructions to each other and for sharing resources.
    </p>
    <br><b>The effectiveness of any data communications system depends upon
      four fundamental characteristics.</b>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><b>Message-</b> message is a piece of information that is to be transmitted from one person to another.It
        would
        be transmitted from one person to another.It could be a text file, an audio file
        ,video file etc.</li>
      <li><b>Sender-</b> is simply a device that sends data message.It can be
        a computer,mobile,telephone,laptop,video camera or workstation etc.
        <br><b>Receiver-</b> is a device that receives messages.It can be a computer,
        telephone,mobile,workstation etc.

      </li>
      <li><b>Transmission Medium/Communication channels-</b> channels are the medium that
        connect two or more workstations. workstations can be connected by either wired media or
        wireless media.
      </li>
      <li><b>Set of Rules(Protocol)-</b> someone sends the data(The sender),it
        should be understandable to the receiver also otherwise it is meaningless.
        For example,sonali sends a message to chetan.If sonali writes in hindi
        and chetan cannot understand hindi,it is meaningless conversation.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <img height="155" src="transmission.png" alt="communication diagram" id="img1">
    <h4 class="ton">Types of data communication</h4>
    <p><b>The data communicationis divided into three types:-</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><b>Simplex Communication-</b> is a one way Communication or we can say
        that unidirectional communication in which one device only
        receives and another device only send data and devices uses their
        entire capacity in transmission.For example,Iot,Entering data using a
        keyboard, listening music using a speaker etc.
      </li>
      <li><b>Half Duplex Communication-</b>It is a two way communication,or we
        can say that is a bidirectional communication in which both the devices can send and
        receive data but not at the same time.For example walkie-Talkie,Intrent browsing.
      </li>
      <li><b>Full Duplex Communication-</b>It is a two way Communication or we can
        say that it is bidirectional communication in which both the devices can send
        and receive data at same time.For example, mobile phone,
        landlines etc.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div>
      <h4>
        <center><b>Protocol and standard in computer networks</b></center>
      </h4>
      <p>Protocols and Standards are important in Computer networks.They are like the rule and guidelines
        that allow different devices and system to communicate and works together
        smoothly.Protocols define how data is sent,received,and processed,while standards ensure that
        various technologies are compatible with each other.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4><b><u>What is Protocol?</u></b></h4>
    <p>A protocol is a set of rules that determines how data is sent and received
      over s network.The protocol is just like a language that computers use to talk to each other, ensuring
      they understand that can respond to each other's message correctly.Protocol help to make sure that
      data moves smootly and securely between devices on a network.
    </p>
    <img height=90 src="protocol.png" alt="protocol" id="img1">
    <p style="background-color: red;">In a above diagram, Protocols are shown as a set of rules.Communication between
      the sender and
      Receiver is not possible without protocol.</p>
    <h4>
      <center><u><b>Key Elements of Protocol</b></u></center>
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><u><b>Timing:</b></u> Timing refers to the synchronization and coordination
        between devices while transferring the data. Timing ensures at what
        time data should be sent and how fast data can be sent. For example,
        If a sender sends 100 Mbps but the receiver can only handle 1 Mbps,
        the receiver will overflow and lose data. Timing ensures preventing
        of data loss, collisions, and other timing-related issues.</li>
      <li><u><b>Sequence Control:</b></u>Sequence control ensures the proper ordering of
        data packets. The main responsibility of sequence control is to
        acknowledge the data while it get received, and the retransmission of
        lost data. Through this mechanism, the data is delivered in correct order.</li>
      <li><u><b>Flow Control:</b></u>Flow Control regulates device data delivery. It limits
        the sender's data or asks the receiver if it's ready for more. Flow
        control prevents data congestion and loss.
      </li>
      <li><u><b>Error Control:</b></u>Error Control mechanisms detect and fix data
        transmission faults. They include error detection codes, data resend,
        and error recovery. Error control detects and corrects noise,
        interference, and other problems to maintain data integrity.</li>
      <li><u><b>Security:</b></u>Network security protects data confidentiality, integrity,
        and authenticity. which includes encryption, authentication, access
        control, and other security procedures. Network communication's
        privacy and trustworthiness are protected by security standards.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Types of Protocol</b></h3>
    <p>Network Layer Protocols</p>
    <p>Transport Layer Protocols</p>
    <p>Application Protocols</p>
    <p>Wireless Protocols</p>
    <p>Routing Protocols</p>
    <p>Security Protocols</p>
    <p>Internet Protocols</p>
    <h3><b>Important Protocols Used in Computer Network</b></h3>
    <p><b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):</b> Ensures data is sent and received accurately by
      breaking it into packets, sending them, and reassembling them at the destination.
      <br><b>IP (Internet Protocol):</b> Addresses and routes the packets to make sure they reach the right
      destination.
      <br><b> HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure):</b> HTTP used for transferring
      web pages on the internet.
      <br><b>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</b> Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
      It allows users to upload and download files.
      <br><b>DNS (Domain Name System): DNS:</b> DNS stands for Domain Name System. An IP address
      is used to identify the connection of a host to the internet uniquely. But, people prefer to use the
      names instead of addresses. Therefore, the system that maps the name to the address is known as
      Domain Name System.
      <br><b>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):</b> Automatically assigns IP addresses
      to devices on a network, ensuring each device has a unique address.
      <br><b>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</b> Used for sending emails. It transfers emails
      from a client to a server or between servers.
      <br><b>SSH (Secure Shell):</b> Provides a secure way to access and manage devices over a network. It
      encrypts the data, making it safe from eavesdropping.c
      <br><b>SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):</b> Used for managing and monitoring network devices like
      routers, switches, and servers. It collects and organizes
      information about these devices.

    <h3 class="osi">OSI Model & TCP/IP</h3>
    <p><b>What Is The OSI Model</b></p>
    The open system interconnection (OSI) model describes
    seven layers that computer system use to communicate over a
    network. It was the first standard model for network comminication,
    adopted by all major computer and
    telecommunication companies in the early 1980s
    The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler
    TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely
    used, as it helps visualize and communicate how networks
    operate, and troubleshoot networking problems.
    OSI was introduced in 1983 by representatives of the major
    computer and telecom companies, and was adopted by ISO as an international standards In 1984.
    <h3 class="osi">Introduction OSI</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It divides network architecture into seven layers
        which, from top to bottom, are the Application,
        Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data
        Link, and Physical Layers. It is therefore often
        referred to as the <b>OSI Seven Layer Model.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="osi">OSI History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In 1978, the International Standars
        Organization (ISO) began to develop its
        OSI framework architecture.</li>
      <li>OSI has two major components: an
        abstract model of networking, called the
        Basic Reference Model or seven-layer
        model, and a set of specific protocols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="osi">OSI Layers</h3>
    <img height=205 src="layer.png" alt="layer" id="img1">
    <p>Going from layer 1 to 7:<b> Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away</b>
      Going from layer 7 to 1:<b> All People Seem To Need Data Processing</b></p>
    <h6><b>Application Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and
      email clients. It provides protocols that allow software to send and receive
      information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples of application
      layer protocols are the <mark>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</mark> (HTTP), File Transfer
      Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
      (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).</p>
    <h6><b>Presentation Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two
      devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it is received correctly on
      the other end. The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application
      layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.
      <br>Presentation layer protocol include MPEG and HTTP/HTML etc
    </p>
    <h6><b>Session Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between
      devices. It is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and
      functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication
      ends. The session layer can also set checkpoints during a data transfer—if the
      session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint</p>
    <h6><b>Transport Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into
      “segments” on the transmitting end. It is responsible for reassembling the segments
      on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer.
      The transport layer carries out flow control, sending data at a rate that matches the
      connection speed of the receiving device, and error control, checking if data was
      received incorrectly and if not, requesting it again.</p>
    <h6><b>Network Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into
      network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end. The other is
      routing packets by discovering the best path across a physical network. The network
      layer uses network addresses (typically Internet Protocol addresses) to route packets
      to a destination node</p>
    <h6><b>Data Link Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two
      physically-connected nodes on a network. It breaks up packets into frames and
      sends them from source to destination. This layer is composed of two parts—
      Logical Link Control (LLC), which identifies network protocols, performs error
      checking and synchronizes frames, and Media Access Control (MAC) which uses
      MAC addresses to connect devices and define permissions to transmit and receive
      data.</p>
    <h6><b>Physical Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection
      between network nodes. It defines the connector, the electrical cable or wireless
      technology connecting the devices, and is responsible for transmission of the raw
      data, which is simply a series of 0s and 1s, while taking care of bit rate control.</p>
    <h5><b><u>Analog Signal</u></b></h5>
    Analog Signals were used in many systems to produce Signals
    to carry information. These signals are continuous in both
    values and time. The use of analog signal has declined with
    the arrival of digital signals.
    <h6><b>Examples of Analog Signals</b></h6>
    Some common examples of analog signals include:
    <ul>
      <li>Human Voice</li>
      <li>Analog Radio and TV Broadcast</li>
      <li>Audio signals transferred via cables</li>
      <li>Radio signals</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><b><u>Digital signals</u></b></h5>
    Digital signal is a type ofcommunication where the data is
    communicated in the form of discrete data.
    <p>Digital signal is mostly done in computers,where the
      data to be transferred is in the form of discrete values.
      Mostly the data is transferred in the form of binary which has
      only two discrete values which are zero and one.
    </p>
    <h6><b>Examples of Digital Signals</b></h6>
    Some common examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>Digital Audio</li>
      <li>Digital Video</li>
      <li>Binary data</li>
      <li>Digital clocks</li>
      <li>Smartphone</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 style="font-family: sans-serif;"><b>DATA RATE LIMIT</b></h5>
    A very important consideration in data communications is how
    fast we can send data, in bits per second, over a channel.
    <p>Date rate depends on three factors:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The bandwidth available</li>
      <li>The level of the signals we use</li>
      <li>The quality of the channel</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700;">Multiplexing</h4>
    <p>Multiplexing is a technique used to combine and send the multiple
      data stream over a single medium. The process of combining the data stream is
      known as Multiplexing and hardware used for multiplexing is known as a multiplexer.
    </p>
    <br>Multiplexing is achieved by using a device called Multiplexer(MUX) that combines n
    input lines to generate a single output line. Multiplexing follow many-to-one,i.e..,n input lines
    and one output line.</br>
    <br>Demultiplexing is achieved by using a device called Demultiplexer (DEMUX) available at the
    receving end. DEMUX seperate a single into its component single(One input and n outputs).
    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700;">History of Multiplexing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiplexing technique is widely used in telecommunications
        in which several telephone calls are carried through a single
        wire.</li>
      <li>Multiplexing originated in telegraphy in the early 1870s and
        is now widely used in communication.</li>
      <li>George Owen Squier developed the telephone carrier
        multiplexing in 1910.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: maroon;">Concept of Multiplexing</h3>
    <img height="120" src="mul.png" alt="multiplexing" id="img1">
    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700; color: maroon;">Frequency-division Multiplexing(FDM)</h4>
    <h6>It is an analog technique</h6>
    <p><b>Frequency Division Multiplexing</b> is a technique in which
      the available bandwidth of a single transmission medium is
      subdivided into several channels.
      <br>Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is a technique of
      multiplexing which means combining more than one signal
      over a shared medium.
      <br>The modulated signals are combined together using a
      multiplexer (MUX) in the sending end. The combined signal
      is transmitted over the communication channel, thus
      allowing multiple independent data streams to be
      transmitted simultaneously. At the receiving end, the
      individual signals are extracted from the combined signal by the process of
      Demultiplexing(DEMUX)
    </p>
    <img height="120" src="fdm.png" alt="fdm" id="img1">
    <p>The following diagram conceptually represents
      multiplexing using FDM. It has 4 frequency bands, each
      of which can carry signal from 1 sender to 1 receiver.
      Each of the 4 senders is allocated a frequency band. The
      four frequency bands are multiplexed and sent via the
      communication channel. At the receiving end, a
      demultiplexer regenerates the original four signals as
      outputs.</p>
    <br><b>Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)</b> is a fiber-optic
    transmission technique that enables the use of multiple light
    wavelengths (or colors) to send data over the same medium.
    Two or more colors of light can travel on one fiber, and
    several signals can be transmitted in an optical waveguide at
    differing wavelengths or frequencies on the optical spectrum.</br>
    <br><b>The Time Division Multiplexing</b> is a digital
    procedure. Here, each sender is given the entire possession
    of the whole bandwidth of the channel for a fixed duration
    of time. After this, the control is moved to the next sender,
    and the process continues on a round-robin basis.
    An example of TDM is the television broadcast. In a
    television serial, generally, a 10 minutes' serial is followed
    by a 5 minutes' advertisement. The time in which the serial
    is being broadcasted, the total frequency is dedicated to the serial.<br>
    <br>
    <p><b>Transmission media</b> refer to the physical pathways through
      which data is transmitted from one device to another within a
      network. These pathways can be wired or wireless. The
      choice of medium depends on factors like distance and speed
      etc.
      <br>
      <center>OR</center></br>
      A Transmission medium is a physical path between the
      transmitter and the receiver i.e. it is the channel through
      which data is sent from one place to another. Transmission
      Media is broadly classified into the following types:
    </p>
    <img height="200" src="tm.png" alt="tm" id="img1">
    <h5><b>Guided Media</b></h5>
    <p>Guided Media is also refer to as Wired or Bounded transmission media.
      Signals being transmitted are direted and confined in a narrow pathway by
      using physical links.
    </p>
    <br>Features:
    <ul>
      <li>High Speed</li>
      <li>Secure</li>
      <li>Used for comparatively shorter distances</li>
    </ul>
    <br>There are 3 major types of Guided Media:
    <br><b>Twisted Pair Cable </b>
    <p>
      It consists of 2 separately insulated conductor wires wound
      about each other. Generally, several such pairs are bundled
      together in a protective sheath. They are the most widely
      used Transmission Media.
    </p>
    <b>Twisted Pair cable is ot two types:</b>
    <ul type="square">
      <li><b>Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable (UTP):</b>UTP consists of two
        insulated copper wires twisted around one another. This
        type of cable has the ability to block interference and does
        not depend on a physical shield for this purpose. It is used
        for telephonic applications. </li>
    </ul>
    <img height="120" src="utp.png" alt="utp" id="img1">
    <p><b>Shielded Twisted Pair(STP):</b>This type of cable consists of
      a special jacket (a copper braid covering or a foil shield) to
      block external interference. It is used in fast-data-rate
      Ethernet and in voice and data channels of telephone lines.</p>
    <img src="stp.png" alt="stp" id="img1">
    <p><b>Coaxial Cable</b> is commonly used by cable operators,
      telephone companies, and internet providers worldwide to
      convey data, video, and voice communications to customers.
      It has also been used extensively within homes.
      It has an inner conductor surrounded by an insulating layer,
      surrounded by conductive shielding (outer conductor), and a
      protective outer jacket.</p>
    <img src="coaxial.png" alt="coaxial" id="img1">
    <p><b><u>A Fiber optic Cable</u></b> is a network cable that contains strands of
      glass fibers inside an insulated casing. They're designed for
      long-distance, high-performance data networking, and
      telecommunications. Compared to wired cables, fiber optic
      cables provide higher bandwidth and transmit data over longer
      distances. Fiber optic cables support much of the world's
      internet, cable television, and telephone systems.</p>
    <img height="90" src="fiber.png" alt="fiber" id="img1">
    <h5><b>Unguided Media</b></h5>
    <p>An unguided transmission transmits the electromagnetic waves
      without using any physical medium. Therefore it is also known
      as wireless transmission.
      <br>In unguided media, air is the media through which the
      electromagnetic energy can flow easily.
    </p>
    <br><b><u>Radio Waves</u></b> are a type of electromagnetic radiation. A radio
    wave has a much longer wavelength than visible light. Humans
    use radio waves extensively for communications. This radio
    tower has both rectangular and circular antennas to transmit
    and receive radio frequency energy.
    <br><b><u>Infrared(IR)</u></b>is a wireless technology that uses light waves
    to transmit data over short to medium ranges in computer
    networks. It's similar to the technology used in many
    household devices, like remote controls and wireless
    headphones.
    <p><b><u>Switching</u></b> is process to forward packets coming in from one
      port to a port leading towards the destination. When data
      comes on a port it is called ingress, and when data leaves a
      port or goes out it is called egress. A communication system
      may include number of switches and nodes.</p>
    <p><b>A telephone network</b> is a telecommunications network that
      connects telephones which allows telephone calls between two
      or more parties, as well as newer features such as fax and internet.</p>
    <b>There are a number of different types of telephone network:</b>
    <p><b>A landline network</b> where the telephones must be directly
      wired into a single telephone exchange This is known as
      the <b>public switched telephone network or PSTN.</b>
      <br>
      <b>A wireless network</b> where the telephones are mobile and can
      move around anywhere within the coverage area.
      <br>A private network where a closed group of telephones are
      connected primarily to each other and use a gateway to reach
      the outside world. This is usually used
      inside companies and call centers and is called a <b>private
        branch exchange (PBX).</b>
    </p>
    <h5>
      <center><u><b>Digital Subscriber Lines(DSL)</b></u></center>
    </h5>
    <p><b>Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL)</b> are a set of technologies that are existing
      telephones lines to transmit digital data,such as internet access</p>
    <br>DSL uses a modem to convert digital data from a computer
    into a format that can be transmitted over the telephone line.<br>
    <br>
    <p>Error is a condition when the receiver's information does not match the sender's.
      Digital signals suffer from noise during
      transmission that can introduce errors in the binary bits
      traveling from sender to receiver. That means a 0 bit may
      change to 1 or a 1 bit may change to 0.
      <br> Error detection and correction are implemented either
      at the data link layer or the transport layer of the OSI model.
    </p>
    <img src="error.png" alt="error" id="img1">
    <h6>Single-Bit Error</h6>
    <div>A single-bit error refers to a type of data transmission error
      that occurs when one bit (i.e., a single binary digit) of a
      transmitted data unit is altered during transmission, resulting
      in an incorrect or corrupted data unit.</div>
    <h4 style="color: rgb(9, 9, 61); text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">Single-bit Error</h4>
    <img src="singlebit.png" alt="single-bit" id="img1">
    <h5><b>Multiple-Bit Error</b></h5>
    <p>A multiple-bit error is an error type that arises when more than
      one bit in a data transmission is affected. Although multiple-bit
      errors are relatively rare when compared to single-bit errors,
      they can still occur, particularly in high-noise or highinterference
      digital environments.</p>

    <h5 style="color: rgb(107, 19, 19); text-align: center; border: black 1px; font-weight: 700;">M-III</h5>
    <p><b>Network Devices:</b>Network devices, also known as networking
      hardware, are physical devices that allow hardware on a
      computer network to communicate and interact with one
      another. For example Repeater, Hub, Bridge, Switch, Routers,
      Gateway, and NIC, etc.
      <br><b>Repeater-</b>A repeater operates at the physical layer. Its job is
      to amplifies (i.e., regenerates) the signal over the same network
      before the signal becomes too weak or corrupted to extend the
      length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same
      network. When the signal becomes weak, they copy it bit by bit
      and regenerate it at its star topology connectors connecting
      following the original strength. It is a 2-port device.
      <br><b>Hub-</b>A hub is a basically multi-port repeater. A hub connects
      multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the
      connector in star topology which connects different stations.
      Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.
    </p>
    <h5><b>Types of Hub</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Active Hub-</b>These are the hubs that have their power
        supply and can clean, boost, and relay the signal along with
        the network. It serves both as a repeater as well as a wiring
        center. These are used to extend the maximum distance
        between nodes.</li>
      <li><b>Passive Hub-</b>These are the hubs that collect wiring from
        nodes and power supply from the active hub. These hubs
        relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting
        them and can't be used to extend the distance between nodes.</li>
      <li><b>Intelligent Hub-</b>It works like an active hub and includes
        remote management capabilities. They also provide flexible
        data rates to network devices. It also enables an administrator
        to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to
        configure each port in the hub.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A layer 2 switch is a type of network switch or device that works
      on the data link layer (OSI Layer 2) and utilizes MAC Address
      to determine the path through where the frames are to be
      forwarded. It uses hardware based switching techniques to
      connect and transmit data in a local area network (LAN).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>MAC Address Table:</b> A Layer-2 switch will keep a MAC
        address table that identifies the MAC address of the
        connected device and the port number. This enables the
        switch to direct frames towards the correct destination.</li>
      <li><b>VLAN Support:</b> Layer-2 switches can support VLANs
        (Virtual Local Area Networks), which means that the network
        can be segmented at this layer.</li>
      <li><b>Switching Frames:</b> These forward Ethernet frames are
        according to MAC addresses and are vital in minimizing
        collision within LANs.</li>
      <li><b>Broadcast Domains:</b> Layer-2 switches do not partition
        broadcast domains, all the devices connected to a Layer-2
        switch are in the same broadcast domain</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">ROUTER</h5>
    <p>A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched
      networks or subnetworks. It serves two primary functions:
      managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data
      packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple
      devices to use the same Internet connection.
      <br>There are several types of routers, but most routers pass data
      between LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area
      networks). A LAN is a group of connected devices restricted to
      a specific geographic area. A LAN usually requires a single route.
      <br>A WAN, by contrast, is a large network spread out over a vast
      geographic area. Large organizations and companies that
      operate in multiple locations across the country, for instance,
      will need separate LANs for each location, which then
      connect to the other LANs to form a WAN. Because a WAN
      is distributed over a large area, it often necessitates multiple
      router and switches.
    </p>
    <h6>What is a Layer 3 switch?</h6>
    <p>Also called a multilayer switch, it is a specialized hardware
      device that has a lot in common with the traditional router—
      both in physical appearance and function. Layer 3 switches
      support the same routing protocols as routers and inspect
      incoming packets, as well as make vital routing decisions the
      same way routers do. And they do these routing tasks in addition
      to performing switching duties. Like routers, Layer 3 switches
      can be configured to support such routing protocols as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Routing Information Protocol(RIP)</li>
      <li>Open Shortest Path First(OSPF)</li>
      <li>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol(EIGRP)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><b>What is the purpose of Layer 3 switches?</b></h5>
    <p>These switches were designed to improve the network routing
      performance on large local area networks (LANs) such as
      corporate intranets.
      <br> While Layer 2 switches can route data traffic dynamically
      when there is low to medium traffic, their performance suffers
      when it increases to a high level.
      <br>The main difference between a router and a Layer 3 switch lies
      inside the hardware itself. Layer 3 switch hardware combines
      that of traditional switch and routers—replacing some of the
      typical router software with integrated circuit hardware that
      provides better LAN performance. In addition, a Layer 3
      switch will not usually have wide area network (WAN) ports which are
      standards in routers.
    </p>
    <p><b>What are the main features of a layer 3 switch? </b>
      <br>These switches feature the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance on two OSI Layer:Layer2 and Layer 3</li>
      <li>usually come in 24 or 48 Ethernet</li>
      <li>Uses a simple switching algorithm </li>
      <li>Routing protocols are simple</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Gateway</h5>
    <p>A gateway is a network node or device that connects two
      networks that use different transmission protocols. Gateways
      play an important role in connecting two networks. It works as
      the entry-exit point for a network because all traffic that
      passes across the networks must pass through the gateway.
      The gateway monitors and controls all the incoming and
      outgoing <u>network traffic</u>.</p>
    <h5>IPV4 AND IPV6</h5>
    <h6>What is IP?</h6>
    <p>An IP, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique set of numbers
      assigned to each device connected to a network, like the
      Internet. It’s like an address for your computer, phone, or any
      other device, allowing them to communicate with each other.
      When you visit a website, your device uses the IP address to
      find and connect to the website’s server.</p>
    <h6>Difference Between Ipv4 and Ipv6</h6>
    <p>The address through which any computer communicates with
      our computer is simply called an Internet Protocol Address or IP
      address. For example, if we want to load a web page or
      download something, we require the address to deliver that
      particular file or webpage. That address is called an IP Address.
      There are two versions of IP: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the older
      version, while IPv6 is the newer one. both have their own features
      and functions.</p>
      <div>
        <p>IP stands for Internet Protocol version v4 stands for Version
          Four (IPv4), is the most widely used system for identifying
          devices on a network. It uses a set of four numbers, separated
          by periods (like 192.168.0.1), to give each device a unique
          address. This address helps data find its way from one device to
          another over the internet.<br>
          <br>IPv4 was the primary version brought into action for production
          within the ARPANET in 1983. IP version four addresses are 32-
          bit integers which will be expressed in decimal
          notation. Example- 192.0.2.126 could be an IPv4 address</p>
