    <h4><b>Network</b></h4>
    <p>Network is a group of computers connected with each other through wires,optical fibres or optical links
      so that various devices can intract with each other through a network.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Networking</b></h4>
    <p>Computer networking refer to interconnected computing devices
      that can exchange data and share resources with each other.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Overview of Data Communication Networks</b></h3>
    <p>Communication is defined as a process in which more than computers
      transfers information, instructions to each other and for sharing resources.
    </p>
    <br><b>The effectiveness of any data communications system depends upon
      four fundamental characteristics.</b>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><b>Message-</b> message is a piece of information that is to be transmitted from one person to another.It
        would
        be transmitted from one person to another.It could be a text file, an audio file
        ,video file etc.</li>
      <li><b>Sender-</b> is simply a device that sends data message.It can be
        a computer,mobile,telephone,laptop,video camera or workstation etc.
        <br><b>Receiver-</b> is a device that receives messages.It can be a computer,
        telephone,mobile,workstation etc.

      </li>
      <li><b>Transmission Medium/Communication channels-</b> channels are the medium that
        connect two or more workstations. workstations can be connected by either wired media or
        wireless media.
      </li>
      <li><b>Set of Rules(Protocol)-</b> someone sends the data(The sender),it
        should be understandable to the receiver also otherwise it is meaningless.
        For example,sonali sends a message to chetan.If sonali writes in hindi
        and chetan cannot understand hindi,it is meaningless conversation.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <img height="155" src="transmission.png" alt="communication diagram" id="img1">
    <h4 class="ton">Types of data communication</h4>
    <p><b>The data communicationis divided into three types:-</b></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><b>Simplex Communication-</b> is a one way Communication or we can say
        that unidirectional communication in which one device only
        receives and another device only send data and devices uses their
        entire capacity in transmission.For example,Iot,Entering data using a
        keyboard, listening music using a speaker etc.
      </li>
      <li><b>Half Duplex Communication-</b>It is a two way communication,or we
        can say that is a bidirectional communication in which both the devices can send and
        receive data but not at the same time.For example walkie-Talkie,Intrent browsing.
      </li>
      <li><b>Full Duplex Communication-</b>It is a two way Communication or we can
        say that it is bidirectional communication in which both the devices can send
        and receive data at same time.For example, mobile phone,
        landlines etc.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div>
      <h4>
        <center><b>Protocol and standard in computer networks</b></center>
      </h4>
      <p>Protocols and Standards are important in Computer networks.They are like the rule and guidelines
        that allow different devices and system to communicate and works together
        smoothly.Protocols define how data is sent,received,and processed,while standards ensure that
        various technologies are compatible with each other.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4><b><u>What is Protocol?</u></b></h4>
    <p>A protocol is a set of rules that determines how data is sent and received
      over s network.The protocol is just like a language that computers use to talk to each other, ensuring
      they understand that can respond to each other's message correctly.Protocol help to make sure that
      data moves smootly and securely between devices on a network.
    </p>
    <img height=90 src="protocol.png" alt="protocol" id="img1">
    <p style="background-color: red;">In a above diagram, Protocols are shown as a set of rules.Communication between
      the sender and
      Receiver is not possible without protocol.</p>
    <h4>
      <center><u><b>Key Elements of Protocol</b></u></center>
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><u><b>Timing:</b></u> Timing refers to the synchronization and coordination
        between devices while transferring the data. Timing ensures at what
        time data should be sent and how fast data can be sent. For example,
        If a sender sends 100 Mbps but the receiver can only handle 1 Mbps,
        the receiver will overflow and lose data. Timing ensures preventing
        of data loss, collisions, and other timing-related issues.</li>
      <li><u><b>Sequence Control:</b></u>Sequence control ensures the proper ordering of
        data packets. The main responsibility of sequence control is to
        acknowledge the data while it get received, and the retransmission of
        lost data. Through this mechanism, the data is delivered in correct order.</li>
      <li><u><b>Flow Control:</b></u>Flow Control regulates device data delivery. It limits
        the sender's data or asks the receiver if it's ready for more. Flow
        control prevents data congestion and loss.
      </li>
      <li><u><b>Error Control:</b></u>Error Control mechanisms detect and fix data
        transmission faults. They include error detection codes, data resend,
        and error recovery. Error control detects and corrects noise,
        interference, and other problems to maintain data integrity.</li>
      <li><u><b>Security:</b></u>Network security protects data confidentiality, integrity,
        and authenticity. which includes encryption, authentication, access
        control, and other security procedures. Network communication's
        privacy and trustworthiness are protected by security standards.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Types of Protocol</b></h3>
    <p>Network Layer Protocols</p>
    <p>Transport Layer Protocols</p>
    <p>Application Protocols</p>
    <p>Wireless Protocols</p>
    <p>Routing Protocols</p>
    <p>Security Protocols</p>
    <p>Internet Protocols</p>
    <h3><b>Important Protocols Used in Computer Network</b></h3>
    <p><b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):</b> Ensures data is sent and received accurately by
      breaking it into packets, sending them, and reassembling them at the destination.
      <br><b>IP (Internet Protocol):</b> Addresses and routes the packets to make sure they reach the right
      destination.
      <br><b> HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure):</b> HTTP used for transferring
      web pages on the internet.
      <br><b>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</b> Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
      It allows users to upload and download files.
      <br><b>DNS (Domain Name System): DNS:</b> DNS stands for Domain Name System. An IP address
      is used to identify the connection of a host to the internet uniquely. But, people prefer to use the
      names instead of addresses. Therefore, the system that maps the name to the address is known as
      Domain Name System.
      <br><b>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):</b> Automatically assigns IP addresses
      to devices on a network, ensuring each device has a unique address.
      <br><b>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</b> Used for sending emails. It transfers emails
      from a client to a server or between servers.
      <br><b>SSH (Secure Shell):</b> Provides a secure way to access and manage devices over a network. It
      encrypts the data, making it safe from eavesdropping.c
      <br><b>SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):</b> Used for managing and monitoring network devices like
      routers, switches, and servers. It collects and organizes
      information about these devices.

    <h3 class="osi">OSI Model & TCP/IP</h3>
    <p><b>What Is The OSI Model</b></p>
    The open system interconnection (OSI) model describes
    seven layers that computer system use to communicate over a
    network. It was the first standard model for network comminication,
    adopted by all major computer and
    telecommunication companies in the early 1980s
    The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler
    TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely
    used, as it helps visualize and communicate how networks
    operate, and troubleshoot networking problems.
    OSI was introduced in 1983 by representatives of the major
    computer and telecom companies, and was adopted by ISO as an international standards In 1984.
    <h3 class="osi">Introduction OSI</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It divides network architecture into seven layers
        which, from top to bottom, are the Application,
        Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data
        Link, and Physical Layers. It is therefore often
        referred to as the <b>OSI Seven Layer Model.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="osi">OSI History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In 1978, the International Standars
        Organization (ISO) began to develop its
        OSI framework architecture.</li>
      <li>OSI has two major components: an
        abstract model of networking, called the
        Basic Reference Model or seven-layer
        model, and a set of specific protocols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="osi">OSI Layers</h3>
    <img height=205 src="layer.png" alt="layer" id="img1">
    <p>Going from layer 1 to 7:<b> Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away</b>
      Going from layer 7 to 1:<b> All People Seem To Need Data Processing</b></p>
    <h6><b>Application Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and
      email clients. It provides protocols that allow software to send and receive
      information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples of application
      layer protocols are the <mark>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</mark> (HTTP), File Transfer
      Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
      (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).</p>
    <h6><b>Presentation Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two
      devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it is received correctly on
      the other end. The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application
      layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.
      <br>Presentation layer protocol include MPEG and HTTP/HTML etc
    </p>
    <h6><b>Session Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between
      devices. It is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and
      functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication
      ends. The session layer can also set checkpoints during a data transfer—if the
      session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint</p>
    <h6><b>Transport Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into
      “segments” on the transmitting end. It is responsible for reassembling the segments
      on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer.
      The transport layer carries out flow control, sending data at a rate that matches the
      connection speed of the receiving device, and error control, checking if data was
      received incorrectly and if not, requesting it again.</p>
    <h6><b>Network Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into
      network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end. The other is
      routing packets by discovering the best path across a physical network. The network
      layer uses network addresses (typically Internet Protocol addresses) to route packets
      to a destination node</p>
    <h6><b>Data Link Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two
      physically-connected nodes on a network. It breaks up packets into frames and
      sends them from source to destination. This layer is composed of two parts—
      Logical Link Control (LLC), which identifies network protocols, performs error
      checking and synchronizes frames, and Media Access Control (MAC) which uses
      MAC addresses to connect devices and define permissions to transmit and receive
      data.</p>
    <h6><b>Physical Layer</b></h6>
    <p>The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection
      between network nodes. It defines the connector, the electrical cable or wireless
      technology connecting the devices, and is responsible for transmission of the raw
      data, which is simply a series of 0s and 1s, while taking care of bit rate control.</p>
    <h5><b><u>Analog Signal</u></b></h5>
    Analog Signals were used in many systems to produce Signals
    to carry information. These signals are continuous in both
    values and time. The use of analog signal has declined with
    the arrival of digital signals.
    <h6><b>Examples of Analog Signals</b></h6>
    Some common examples of analog signals include:
    <ul>
      <li>Human Voice</li>
      <li>Analog Radio and TV Broadcast</li>
      <li>Audio signals transferred via cables</li>
      <li>Radio signals</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><b><u>Digital signals</u></b></h5>
    Digital signal is a type ofcommunication where the data is
    communicated in the form of discrete data.
    <p>Digital signal is mostly done in computers,where the
      data to be transferred is in the form of discrete values.
      Mostly the data is transferred in the form of binary which has
      only two discrete values which are zero and one.
    </p>
    <h6><b>Examples of Digital Signals</b></h6>
    Some common examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>Digital Audio</li>
      <li>Digital Video</li>
      <li>Binary data</li>
      <li>Digital clocks</li>
      <li>Smartphone</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 style="font-family: sans-serif;"><b>DATA RATE LIMIT</b></h5>
    A very important consideration in data communications is how
    fast we can send data, in bits per second, over a channel.
    <p>Date rate depends on three factors:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The bandwidth available</li>
      <li>The level of the signals we use</li>
      <li>The quality of the channel</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700;">Multiplexing</h4>
    <p>Multiplexing is a technique used to combine and send the multiple
      data stream over a single medium. The process of combining the data stream is
      known as Multiplexing and hardware used for multiplexing is known as a multiplexer.
    </p>
    <br>Multiplexing is achieved by using a device called Multiplexer(MUX) that combines n
    input lines to generate a single output line. Multiplexing follow many-to-one,i.e..,n input lines
    and one output line.</br>
    <br>Demultiplexing is achieved by using a device called Demultiplexer (DEMUX) available at the
    receving end. DEMUX seperate a single into its component single(One input and n outputs).
    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700;">History of Multiplexing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiplexing technique is widely used in telecommunications
        in which several telephone calls are carried through a single
        wire.</li>
      <li>Multiplexing originated in telegraphy in the early 1870s and
        is now widely used in communication.</li>
      <li>George Owen Squier developed the telephone carrier
        multiplexing in 1910.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>It is an analog technique</h6>
    <p><b>Frequency Division Multiplexing</b> is a technique in which
      the available bandwidth of a single transmission medium is
      subdivided into several channels.
      <br>Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is a technique of
      multiplexing which means combining more than one signal
      over a shared medium.
      <br>The modulated signals are combined together using a
      multiplexer (MUX) in the sending end. The combined signal
      is transmitted over the communication channel, thus
      allowing multiple independent data streams to be
      transmitted simultaneously. At the receiving end, the
      individual signals are extracted from the combined signal by the process of
      Demultiplexing(DEMUX)
    </p>
    <img height="120" src="fdm.png" alt="fdm" id="img1">
    <p>The following diagram conceptually represents
      multiplexing using FDM. It has 4 frequency bands, each
      of which can carry signal from 1 sender to 1 receiver.
      Each of the 4 senders is allocated a frequency band. The
      four frequency bands are multiplexed and sent via the
      communication channel. At the receiving end, a
      demultiplexer regenerates the original four signals as
      outputs.</p>
    <br><b>Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)</b> is a fiber-optic
    transmission technique that enables the use of multiple light
    wavelengths (or colors) to send data over the same medium.
    Two or more colors of light can travel on one fiber, and
    several signals can be transmitted in an optical waveguide at
    differing wavelengths or frequencies on the optical spectrum.</br>
    <br><b>The Time Division Multiplexing</b> is a digital
    procedure. Here, each sender is given the entire possession
    of the whole bandwidth of the channel for a fixed duration
    of time. After this, the control is moved to the next sender,
    and the process continues on a round-robin basis.
    An example of TDM is the television broadcast. In a
    television serial, generally, a 10 minutes' serial is followed
    by a 5 minutes' advertisement. The time in which the serial
    is being broadcasted, the total frequency is dedicated to the serial.<br>
    <br>
    <p><b>Transmission media</b> refer to the physical pathways through
      which data is transmitted from one device to another within a
      network. These pathways can be wired or wireless. The
      choice of medium depends on factors like distance and speed
      etc.
      <br>
      <center>OR</center></br>
      A Transmission medium is a physical path between the
      transmitter and the receiver i.e. it is the channel through
      which data is sent from one place to another. Transmission
      Media is broadly classified into the following types:
    </p>
    <img height="200" src="tm.png" alt="tm" id="img1">
    <h5><b>Guided Media</b></h5>
    <p>Guided Media is also refer to as Wired or Bounded transmission media.
      Signals being transmitted are direted and confined in a narrow pathway by
      using physical links.
    </p>
    <br>Features:
    <ul>
      <li>High Speed</li>
      <li>Secure</li>
      <li>Used for comparatively shorter distances</li>
    </ul>
    <br>There are 3 major types of Guided Media:
    <br><b>Twisted Pair Cable </b>
    <p>
      It consists of 2 separately insulated conductor wires wound
      about each other. Generally, several such pairs are bundled
      together in a protective sheath. They are the most widely
      used Transmission Media.
    </p>
    <b>Twisted Pair cable is ot two types:</b>
    <ul type="square">
      <li><b>Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable (UTP):</b>UTP consists of two
        insulated copper wires twisted around one another. This
        type of cable has the ability to block interference and does
        not depend on a physical shield for this purpose. It is used
        for telephonic applications. </li>
    </ul>
    <img height="120" src="utp.png" alt="utp" id="img1">
    <p><b>Shielded Twisted Pair(STP):</b>This type of cable consists of
      a special jacket (a copper braid covering or a foil shield) to
      block external interference. It is used in fast-data-rate
      Ethernet and in voice and data channels of telephone lines.</p>
    <img src="stp.png" alt="stp" id="img1">
    <p><b>Coaxial Cable</b> is commonly used by cable operators,
      telephone companies, and internet providers worldwide to
      convey data, video, and voice communications to customers.
      It has also been used extensively within homes.
      It has an inner conductor surrounded by an insulating layer,
      surrounded by conductive shielding (outer conductor), and a
      protective outer jacket.</p>
    <img src="coaxial.png" alt="coaxial" id="img1">
    <p><b><u>A Fiber optic Cable</u></b> is a network cable that contains strands of
      glass fibers inside an insulated casing. They're designed for
      long-distance, high-performance data networking, and
      telecommunications. Compared to wired cables, fiber optic
      cables provide higher bandwidth and transmit data over longer
      distances. Fiber optic cables support much of the world's
      internet, cable television, and telephone systems.</p>
    <img height="90" src="fiber.png" alt="fiber" id="img1">
    <h5><b>Unguided Media</b></h5>
    <p>An unguided transmission transmits the electromagnetic waves
      without using any physical medium. Therefore it is also known
      as wireless transmission.
      <br>In unguided media, air is the media through which the
      electromagnetic energy can flow easily.
    </p>
    <br><b><u>Radio Waves</u></b> are a type of electromagnetic radiation. A radio
    wave has a much longer wavelength than visible light. Humans
    use radio waves extensively for communications. This radio
    tower has both rectangular and circular antennas to transmit
    and receive radio frequency energy.
    <br><b><u>Infrared(IR)</u></b>is a wireless technology that uses light waves
    to transmit data over short to medium ranges in computer
    networks. It's similar to the technology used in many
    household devices, like remote controls and wireless
    headphones.
    <p><b><u>Switching</u></b> is process to forward packets coming in from one
      port to a port leading towards the destination. When data
      comes on a port it is called ingress, and when data leaves a
      port or goes out it is called egress. A communication system
      may include number of switches and nodes.</p>
    <p><b>A telephone network</b> is a telecommunications network that
      connects telephones which allows telephone calls between two
      or more parties, as well as newer features such as fax and internet.</p>
    <b>There are a number of different types of telephone network:</b>
    <p><b>A landline network</b> where the telephones must be directly
      wired into a single telephone exchange This is known as
      the <b>public switched telephone network or PSTN.</b>
      <br>
      <b>A wireless network</b> where the telephones are mobile and can
      move around anywhere within the coverage area.
      <br>A private network where a closed group of telephones are
      connected primarily to each other and use a gateway to reach
      the outside world. This is usually used
      inside companies and call centers and is called a <b>private
        branch exchange (PBX).</b>
    </p>
    <h5>
      <center><u><b>Digital Subscriber Lines(DSL)</b></u></center>
    </h5>
    <p><b>Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL)</b> are a set of technologies that are existing
      telephones lines to transmit digital data,such as internet access</p>
    <br>DSL uses a modem to convert digital data from a computer
    into a format that can be transmitted over the telephone line.<br>
    <br>
    <p>Error is a condition when the receiver's information does not match the sender's.
      Digital signals suffer from noise during
      transmission that can introduce errors in the binary bits
      traveling from sender to receiver. That means a 0 bit may
      change to 1 or a 1 bit may change to 0.
      <br> Error detection and correction are implemented either
      at the data link layer or the transport layer of the OSI model.

    <h6>Single-Bit Error</h6>
    <div>A single-bit error refers to a type of data transmission error
      that occurs when one bit (i.e., a single binary digit) of a
      transmitted data unit is altered during transmission, resulting
      in an incorrect or corrupted data unit.</div>
    <h4 style="color: rgb(9, 9, 61); text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">Single-bit Error</h4>
    <img src="singlebit.png" alt="single-bit" id="img1">
    <h5><b>Multiple-Bit Error</b></h5>
    <p>A multiple-bit error is an error type that arises when more than
      one bit in a data transmission is affected. Although multiple-bit
      errors are relatively rare when compared to single-bit errors,
      they can still occur, particularly in high-noise or highinterference
      digital environments.</p>
    <img src="mulbit.png" alt="multiplebit" id="img1">
    <h5>Burst Error</h5>
    <p>When several consecutive bits are flipped mistakenly in digital
      transmission, it creates a burst error. This error causes a sequence of
      consecutive incorrect values.</p>
    <img src="be.png" alt="be" id="img1">
    <div>Error detection mechanisms are crucial for identifying errors in data during
      transmission over networks. Here’s an overview of common error detection
      mechanisms, including linear codes, Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), and
      checksum.
      <ol>
        <li><b>Linear Codes</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Concept:</b>Linear codes are a type of error-detecting code that use algebraic
            structures. The simplest form is a parity bit, which ensures that the number
            of 1s in the data is even (even parity) or odd (odd parity).</li>
          <li><b>Mechanism:</b>The sender adds an extra bit (parity bit) to each data frame.
            The receiver checks if the total number of 1s is even or odd, depending on
            the agreed parity.</li>
          <li><b>Application:</b>Parity checks are effective at detecting single-bit errors but are
            limited because they cannot detect multiple-bit errors.</li>
          <li><b>Examples:</b>Simple parity check, two-dimensional parity, Hamming code
            (used for error detection and correction).</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b><u>Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC)</u></b></li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>concept:</b>CRC is a widely used error-detection method that involves treating
            the data as a binary number, dividing it by a fixed binary polynomial, and
            appending the remainder to the data.</li>
          <li><b>Mechanism:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Mechanism:
              Both sender and receiver agree on a fixed binary divisor (the
              generator polynomial).</li>
            <li>The sender divides the data by this polynomial and appends the
              remainder (CRC value) to the data.</li>
            <li>The receiver performs the same division on the received data. If the
              remainder is zero, the data is assumed to be error-free; otherwise, an
              error is detected.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Application:</b>CRC is highly effective at detecting burst errors and is
            commonly used in network protocols like Ethernet and USB.</li>
          <li><b>Examples:</b>CRC-8, CRC-16, CRC-32 (where the number indicates the length
            of the CRC code in bits).</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b><u>Checksum</u></b></li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Concept:</b>The checksum is a simple method where data is divided into
            equal-sized blocks, summed, and the sum’s complement is added to the data
            as the checksum.</li>
          <li><b>Mechanism:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Data is divided into fixed-size segments (e.g., 16 bits).</li>
            <li>The segments are added up to produce a sum.</li>
            <li>The sum is complemented (inverted) and appended to the data as the
              checksum.</li>
            <li>The receiver calculates the checksum by summing the received
              segments, including the checksum. If the result is zero, the data is
              assumed to be error-free.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Application:</b>Checksum is simpler but less robust than CRC and is used in
            error detection for protocols like TCP/IP, where simpler error-checking is
            needed.</li>
          <li><b>Example:</b>Internet Checksum (used in TCP/IP and UDP protocols).</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>Error correction</b> mechanisms not only detect errors in transmitted data but
      also allow the receiver to reconstruct the original data without needing
      retransmission. These mechanisms are particularly important in
      environments where retransmissions are costly or impractical, such as
      satellite communications, deep-space missions, or streaming applications.
      Common Error Correction Mechanisms.
      <ol>
        <li><b>Hamming Code</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Concept:</b>Hamming code is an error-correcting code that can detect up to
            two-bit errors and correct single-bit errors in data.</li>
          <li><b>Mechanism:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Redundant bits are added to the data in specific positions.</li>
            <li>These bits are calculated based on parity for groups of positions,
              with each redundant bit covering certain data bits.</li>
            <li>At the receiver's end, the parity bits are recalculated. If there's a
              discrepancy, the pattern of discrepancies points to the exact bit that is
              in error, allowing single-bit error correction.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Application:</b>Used in memory systems, telecommunications, and data
            storage systems where low levels of errors are anticipated.</li>
          <li><b>Limitations:</b>Hamming codes are limited to single-bit error correction and
            are not ideal for handling high error rates.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p><b>Data Link Control</b> is a set of protocols and mechanisms used to ensure reliable
      communication over a network at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It
      includes both flow control and error control, which are essential for handling data
      frames effectively and preventing issues like data loss, congestion, or duplication.</p>
    <p><b>Flow control</b> Flow control is used to manage the rate at which data is transmitted between a sender
      and a receiver to prevent the receiver from being overwhelmed by too much data too
      quickly. The two main types of flow control techniques are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Stop-and-Wait:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>In the Stop-and-Wait protocol, the sender transmits a single frame and then
          waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver before sending the
          next frame.</li>
        <li>This simple approach ensures that data is sent in an orderly fashion and
          prevents the receiver's buffer from overflowing.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><b>Sliding Window:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>In the Sliding Window protocol, the sender can transmit multiple frames
          before needing an acknowledgment.</li>
        <li>It uses a "window" of sequence numbers to manage frames that can be sent
          or received at a time, providing greater efficiency by allowing a continuous
          flow of frames.</li>
        <li>This approach is widely used in reliable transmission protocols (like TCP).</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <h4><b>Error control</b></h4>
    <p>Error control is responsible for detecting and correcting errors that occur during
      transmission. It ensures data integrity and can request retransmission if errors are
      detected. There are three main error control methods:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Automatic Repeat request(ARQ):</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>ARQ is a family of protocols that include error detection and retransmission
          strategies.</li>
        <li>When an error is detected, a frame is either retransmitted or dropped based
          on certain conditions, and mechanisms like acknowledgments (ACKs) or
          negative acknowledgments (NAKs) are used.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><b>Forward Error correction(FEC):</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>When an error is detected, a frame is either retransmitted or dropped based
          on certain conditions, and mechanisms like acknowledgments (ACKs) or
          negative acknowledgments (NAKs) are used.</li>
        <li>This technique is often used in real-time applications where retransmission
          would cause unacceptable delays.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><b>Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC):</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>CRC is an error-detection method that attaches a checksum to each frame,
          allowing the receiver to detect any data corruption that might have occurred
          during transmission.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <h5><b>Stop-and-Wait ARQ Protocol</b></h5>
    <p>The Stop-and-Wait ARQ is a specific flow and error control protocol based on the
      Stop-and-Wait approach. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Frame Transmission:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>The sender sends a frame and waits for an acknowledgment from the
          receiver</li>
        <li>If the receiver successfully receives the frame without errors, it sends an
          acknowledgment (ACK) back to the sender.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><b>Acknowledgment and retransmission:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>If the sender receives an ACK, it proceeds to send the next frame.</li>
        <li>If no acknowledgment is received within a certain time frame (due to a frame
          loss or error), the sender will retransmit the frame.</li>
        <li>This prevents data loss in case of transmission errors.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><b>Error Handling with Timeout:</b></li>
      <ol>
        <li>A timer is used to monitor the time taken to receive an ACK. If the timer
          expires, the sender retransmits the frame, assuming it was lost or corrupted
          during transmission.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <h4>Multiple Access Techniques</h4>
    <p>Multiple Access techniques determine how multiple devices share the same
      communication medium efficiently. They can be grouped into three main categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Random Access:</b>
        In Random Access, devices access the channel whenever they have data to send,
        leading to possible collisions, which are then managed by various protocols:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>ALOHA:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A simple protocol where devices transmit data whenever they are ready.</li>
          <li>Collisions occur when two or more devices send data at the same time. After
            a collision, devices wait a random time before retrying</li>
          <li>Variants: Pure ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA, where Slotted ALOHA reduces
            collisions by allowing transmissions only at specific time slots.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>CSMA(Carrier Sense Multiple Access):</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Devices sense the channel to check if it is idle before transmitting. If busy,
            they wait until it is free.</li>
          <li>CSMA/CD (Collision Detection): Used in wired networks, especially
            Ethernet, where devices detect collisions and stop transmission, wait, and
            then retry.</li>
          <li>CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance): Used in wireless networks, where
            collision detection is challenging. Devices wait before transmitting and use
            acknowledgment signals to minimize collisions.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h5>Controlled Access</h5>
    In controlled Access, a centralized contol mechanism or protocol determine
    which device can access the medium at any time,which help avoid collisions:
    <ul>
      <li>Polling:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A controller (like a primary device or access point) polls each device in turn,
          asking if it has data to transmit.</li>
        <li>A controller (like a primary device or access point) polls each device in turn,
          asking if it has data to transmit.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Reservation:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Devices reserve the channel for specific time slots or channels, typically in
          advance, reducing the likelihood of collision.</li>
        <li>Often used in time-sensitive applications where reliable access is required,
          like satellite and cellular networks.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Token Passing:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A "token" (a control frame) circulates among devices, and only the device
          holding the token can transmit data.</li>
        <li>Token Ring and Token Bus networks use this method, effectively eliminating
          collisions but requiring coordination.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h5><b>Channelization</b></h5>
    <p>Channelization divides the channel into distinct sections that multiple user can
      access simultaneously,usually by frequency, time or code:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>FDMA(Frequency Division Multiple Access):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The available bandwidth is divided into frequency bands, with each device
          assigned its own band</li>
        <li>Used in radio and satelite communications.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>TDMA(Time Division Multiple Access):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Devices take turns transmitting data in designated time slots.</li>
        <li>Widely used in cellular networks, allowing multiple users on the same
          frequency.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>CDMA(Code Division Multiple Access):</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Devices use unique codes to encode their transmissions, allowing multiple
          transmissions on the same frequency.</li>
        <li>Commonly used in cellular networks, where multiple users can share the
          same spectrum without interfering with each other.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h6><b>Wired LANs(Ethernet)</b></h6>
    <p>Ethernet is the dominant standard for wired LANs, known for its simplicity,
      scalability, and cost-effectiveness. It has evolved over the years, resulting in different
      types of Ethernet standards:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Traditional Ethernet(10 Mbps)</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Original Ethernet, based on the IEEE 802.3 standard, operates at 10 Mbps over
          coaxial cable or twisted-pair cables.</li>
        <li>Uses CSMA/CD for medium access control in half-duplex mode (where only one
          device can transmit at a time).</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Fast Ethernet(100 Mbps)</b></li>

    <p><b>Network Devices:</b>Network devices, also known as networking
      hardware, are physical devices that allow hardware on a
      computer network to communicate and interact with one
      another. For example Repeater, Hub, Bridge, Switch, Routers,
      Gateway, and NIC, etc.
      <br><b>Repeater-</b>A repeater operates at the physical layer. Its job is
      to amplifies (i.e., regenerates) the signal over the same network
      before the signal becomes too weak or corrupted to extend the
      length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same
      network. When the signal becomes weak, they copy it bit by bit
      and regenerate it at its star topology connectors connecting
      following the original strength. It is a 2-port device.
      <br><b>Hub-</b>A hub is a basically multi-port repeater. A hub connects
      multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the
      connector in star topology which connects different stations.
      Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.
    </p>
    <h5><b>Types of Hub</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Active Hub-</b>These are the hubs that have their power
        supply and can clean, boost, and relay the signal along with
        the network. It serves both as a repeater as well as a wiring
        center. These are used to extend the maximum distance
        between nodes.</li>
      <li><b>Passive Hub-</b>These are the hubs that collect wiring from
        nodes and power supply from the active hub. These hubs
        relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting
        them and can't be used to extend the distance between nodes.</li>
      <li><b>Intelligent Hub-</b>It works like an active hub and includes
        remote management capabilities. They also provide flexible
        data rates to network devices. It also enables an administrator
        to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to
        configure each port in the hub.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A layer 2 switch is a type of network switch or device that works
      on the data link layer (OSI Layer 2) and utilizes MAC Address
      to determine the path through where the frames are to be
      forwarded. It uses hardware based switching techniques to
      connect and transmit data in a local area network (LAN).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>MAC Address Table:</b> A Layer-2 switch will keep a MAC
        address table that identifies the MAC address of the
        connected device and the port number. This enables the
        switch to direct frames towards the correct destination.</li>
      <li><b>VLAN Support:</b> Layer-2 switches can support VLANs
        (Virtual Local Area Networks), which means that the network
        can be segmented at this layer.</li>
      <li><b>Switching Frames:</b> These forward Ethernet frames are
        according to MAC addresses and are vital in minimizing
        collision within LANs.</li>
      <li><b>Broadcast Domains:</b> Layer-2 switches do not partition
        broadcast domains, all the devices connected to a Layer-2
        switch are in the same broadcast domain</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 800;">ROUTER</h5>
    <p>A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched
      networks or subnetworks. It serves two primary functions:
      managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data
      packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple
      devices to use the same Internet connection.
      <br>There are several types of routers, but most routers pass data
      between LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area
      networks). A LAN is a group of connected devices restricted to
      a specific geographic area. A LAN usually requires a single route.
      <br>A WAN, by contrast, is a large network spread out over a vast
      geographic area. Large organizations and companies that
      operate in multiple locations across the country, for instance,
      will need separate LANs for each location, which then
      connect to the other LANs to form a WAN. Because a WAN
      is distributed over a large area, it often necessitates multiple
      router and switches.
    </p>
    <h6>What is a Layer 3 switch?</h6>
    <p>Also called a multilayer switch, it is a specialized hardware
      device that has a lot in common with the traditional router—
      both in physical appearance and function. Layer 3 switches
      support the same routing protocols as routers and inspect
      incoming packets, as well as make vital routing decisions the
      same way routers do. And they do these routing tasks in addition
      to performing switching duties. Like routers, Layer 3 switches
      can be configured to support such routing protocols as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Routing Information Protocol(RIP)</li>
      <li>Open Shortest Path First(OSPF)</li>
      <li>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol(EIGRP)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><b>What is the purpose of Layer 3 switches?</b></h5>
    <p>These switches were designed to improve the network routing
      performance on large local area networks (LANs) such as
      corporate intranets.
      <br> While Layer 2 switches can route data traffic dynamically
      when there is low to medium traffic, their performance suffers
      when it increases to a high level.
      <br>The main difference between a router and a Layer 3 switch lies
      inside the hardware itself. Layer 3 switch hardware combines
      that of traditional switch and routers—replacing some of the
      typical router software with integrated circuit hardware that
      provides better LAN performance. In addition, a Layer 3
      switch will not usually have wide area network (WAN) ports which are
      standards in routers.
    </p>
    <p><b>What are the main features of a layer 3 switch? </b>
      <br>These switches feature the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance on two OSI Layer:Layer2 and Layer 3</li>
      <li>usually come in 24 or 48 Ethernet</li>
      <li>Uses a simple switching algorithm </li>
      <li>Routing protocols are simple</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Gateway</h5>
    <p>A gateway is a network node or device that connects two
      networks that use different transmission protocols. Gateways
      play an important role in connecting two networks. It works as
      the entry-exit point for a network because all traffic that
      passes across the networks must pass through the gateway.
      The gateway monitors and controls all the incoming and
      outgoing <u>network traffic</u>.</p>
    <h5>IPV4 AND IPV6</h5>
    <h6>What is IP?</h6>
    <p>An IP, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique set of numbers
      assigned to each device connected to a network, like the
      Internet. It’s like an address for your computer, phone, or any
      other device, allowing them to communicate with each other.
      When you visit a website, your device uses the IP address to
      find and connect to the website’s server.</p>
    <h6>Difference Between Ipv4 and Ipv6</h6>
    <p>The address through which any computer communicates with
      our computer is simply called an Internet Protocol Address or IP
      address. For example, if we want to load a web page or
      download something, we require the address to deliver that
      particular file or webpage. That address is called an IP Address.
      There are two versions of IP: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the older
      version, while IPv6 is the newer one. both have their own features
      and functions.</p>
    <div>
      <p>IP stands for Internet Protocol version v4 stands for Version
        Four (IPv4), is the most widely used system for identifying
        devices on a network. It uses a set of four numbers, separated
        by periods (like 192.168.0.1), to give each device a unique
        address. This address helps data find its way from one device to
        another over the internet.<br>
        <br>IPv4 was the primary version brought into action for production
        within the ARPANET in 1983. IP version four addresses are 32-
        bit integers which will be expressed in decimal
        notation. Example- 192.0.2.126 could be an IPv4 address
      </p>
    </div>
    <h5><b>IPv4 Address Format</b></h5>
    <p>IPv4 Address Format is a 32-bit Address that comprises binary
      digits separated by a dot (.).</p>
    <img src="ipv4.png" alt="ipv4" id="img1">
    <h5><b>What is IPv6</b></h5>
    <p>IPv6 is based on IPv4 and stands for Internet Protocol version
      6. It was first introduced in December 1995 by Internet
      Engineering Task Force. IP version 6 is the new version of
      Internet Protocol, which is way better than IP version 4 in
      terms of complexity and efficiency. IPv6 is written as a group
      of 8 hexadecimal numbers separated by colon (:). It can be
      written as 128 bits of 0s and 1s.
    </p>
    <h6><b>IPv6 Address Format</b></h6>
    <p>IPv6 Address Format is a 128-bit IP Address, which is written
      in a group of 8 hexadecimal numbers separated by colon (:).</p>
    <img src="ipv6.png" alt="ipv6" id="img1">
    <p>IP stands for Internet Protocol and v4 stands for Version
      Four (IPv4). IPv4 was the primary version brought into action
      for production within the ARPANET in 1983. IP version four
      addresses are 32-bit integers which will be expressed in decimal
      notation. In this article, we will discuss about IPv4 datagram
      header.</p>
    <h5><b>What is IPv4?</b></h5>
    <p>IPv4 is a connectionless protocol used for packet-switched
      networks. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth
      revision of the Internet Protocol and a widely used protocol in
      data communication over different kinds of networks. IPv4 is a
      connectionless protocol used in packet-switched layer networks,
      such as Ethernet. It provides a logical connection between
      network devices by providing identification for each device.
      <br>There are many ways to configure IPv4 with all kinds of
      devices – including manual and automatic configurations –
      depending on the network type. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses for
      Ethernet communication in five classes: A, B, C, D and E.
      Classes A, B, and C have a different bit length for addressing
      the network host. Class D addresses are reserved
      for multicasting, while class E addresses are reserved for
      military purposes.

    </ul>
    <p><b>IPv6 packet format has several advantages, including:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Larger address Space</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>IPv6 packets have a 128-bit address, which is much larger
          than IPv4's 32-bit address. This means there are almost an
          unlimited number of unique IP addresses, which is important
          for the internet's growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Streamlined header</b></li>

        <li>IPv6 eliminates the need for NAT, which reduces complexity
          and processing overhead.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4><b>Network Layer Protocols</b></h4>
    <p>Network Layer is responsible for the transmission of data or
      communication from one host to another host connected in a
      network. Rather than describing how data is transferred, it
      implements the technique for efficient transmission. In order to
      provide efficient communication protocols are used at the
      network layer. The data is being grouped into packets or in the
      case of extremely large data it is divided into smaller sub
      packets. Each protocol used has specific features and
      advantages. The below article covers in detail the protocols used
      at the network layer.</p>
    <h6><b>ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)</b></h6>
    <p>ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. ARP is used to
      convert the logical address ie. IP address into physical address
      ie. MAC address. While communicating with other nodes, it
      is necessary to know the MAC address or physical address of
      the destination node. If any of the node in a network wants to
      know the physical address of another node in the same
      network, the host then sends an ARP query packet. This ARP
      query packet consists of IP address and MAC address of
      source host and only the IP address of destination host. This
      ARP packet is then received to every node present in the
      network. The node with its own IP address recognises it and
      sends it MAC address to the requesting node. But sending and
      receiving such packets to know the MAC address of
      destination node it increases the traffic load. Therefore in
      order to reduce this traffic and improve the performance, the
      systems that makes use of ARP maintain a cache of recently
      acquired IP into MAC address bindings.</p>
    Types of ARP Entries
    <ul>
      <li><b>Static Entry:</b>This type of entry is created when a user uses the ARP
        command utility to manually enter the IP to MAC address association.</li>
      <li><b>Dynamic Entry:</b>A dynamic entry is one that is automatically formed when a
        sender broadcasts their message to the whole network. Dynamic entries are
        periodically removed and are not permanent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><b>RARP(Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)</b></h5>
    <p>RARP stands for Reverse Address Resolution Protocol. RARP works opposite of
      ARP. Reverse Address Resolution Protocol is used to convert MAC address ie.
      physical address into IP address ie. logical address. RARP provides with a feature for
      the systems and applications to get their own IP address from a DNS( Domain Name
      System) or router. This type of resolution is required for various tasks such as
      executing reverse DNS lookup. As Reverse Address Resolution Protocol works at low
      level it requires direct network addresses. The reply from the server mostly carries a
      small information but the 32 bit internet address is used and it does not exploit the full
      potential of a network such as ethernet</p>
    <h5><b>How dows RARP work?</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Data is sent between two places in a network using the RARP, which is on the
        Network Access Layer.</li>
      <li>Every user on the network has two distinct addresses: their MAC (physical) address
        and their IP (logical) address.</li>
      <li>Software assigns the IP address, and the hardware then builds the MAC address into
        the device.</li>
      <li>Any regular computer connected to the network can function as the RARP server,
        answering to RARP queries. It must, however, store all of the MAC addresses’
        associated IP addresses. Only these RARP servers are able to respond to RARP
        requests that are received by the network. The information package must be
        transmitted over the network’s lowest tiers</li>
      <li>Using both its physical address and Ethernet broadcast address, the client transmits
        a RARP request. In response, the server gives the client its IP address.</li>

    </ul>
    <img src="rarp.png" alt="rarp" id="img1">
    <h5><b>ICMP</b></h5>
    <p>ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. ICMP is a part of IP protocol
      suite. ICMP is an error reporting and network diagnostic protocol. Feedback in the
      network is reported to the designated host. Meanwhile, if any kind of error occur it
      is then reported to ICMP. ICMP protocol consists of many error reporting and
      diagnostic messages. ICMP protocol handles various kinds of errors such as time
      exceeded, redirection, source quench, destination unreachable, parameter
      problems etc. The messages in ICMP are divided into two types. They are given below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Error Message:</b>Error message states about the issues or problems that are faced
        by the host or routers during processing of IP packet</li>
      <li><b>Query Message:</b>Query messages are used by the host in order to get information
        from a router or another host.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><b>How Does ICMP Work/</b></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The main and most significant protocol in the IP suite is called ICMP. However,
        unlike TCP and UDP, ICMP is a connectionless protocol, meaning it doesn’t
        require a connection to be established with the target device in order to transmit a
        message.</li>
      <li>TCP and ICMP operate differently from one another; TCP is a connection-oriented
        protocol, while ICMP operates without a connection. Every time a connection is
        made prior to a message being sent, a TCP Handshake is required of both devices.</li>
      <li>Datagrams including an IP header containing ICMP data are used to transmit
        ICMP packets. An independent data item like a packet is comparable to an ICMP
        datagram.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="img1.png" alt="img" id="img1">
    <h5><b><u>IGMP(Internet Group Message Protocol)</u></b></h5>
    <p>IGMP stands for Internet Group Message Protocol. IGMP is a
      multicasting communication protocol. It utilizes the resources
      efficiently while broadcasting the messages and data packets.
      IGMP is also a protocol used by TCP/IP. Other hosts connected
      in the network and routers makes use of IGMP for multicasting
      communication that have IP networks. In many networks
      multicast routers are used in order to transmit the messages to
      all the nodes. Multicast routers therefore receives large number
      of packets that needs to be sent. But to broadcast this packets is
      difficult as it would increase the overall network load.
      Therefore IGMP helps the multicast routers by addressing them
      while broadcasting. As multicast communication consists of
      more than one senders and receivers the Internet Group
      Message Protocol is majorly used in various applications such
      as streaming media, web conference tools, games, etc.
    <br>Routing protocols are the set of rules and algorithms that
    routers use to communicate with each other to find the most
    efficient path to transmit data packets from a sender to a
    receiver.</p>
    <h5><b><u>Unicast Routing Protocols</u></b></h5>
    <p>Unicast is a type of information transfer and it is used when
      there is a participation of single sender and single recipient.
      So, in short, you can term it as a one-to-one mapping. For
      example, a device having IP address 10.1.4.0 in a network
      wants to send the traffic stream (data packets) to the device
      with IP address 20.14.4.2 in the other network, then unicast
      comes into the picture. It is the most common form of data
      transfer over the networks.</p>
      <h6><b>Advantage of Unicast</b></h6>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Simplicity:</b>Unicast is very simple to implement as well as to
          manage since the data is transferred to a particular and explicit
          recipient.</li>
        <li><b>Reliable Communication:</b>As the data is sent to one receiver
          it provides the assurance of delivery and the acknowledgment
          from the receiver end which makes it ideal for reliable methods
          of communication such as TCP.</li>
        <li><b>Security:</b>Since these are one-to-one communications, it is
          safer than the broadcast or multicast and can be used for
          transferring data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5><b>Disadvantage of Unicast</b></h5>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Inefficiency for Group communication:</b>For that reason,
          with the same data that needs to be sent to multiple receivers,
          Unicast may prove highly inefficient because each requires a
          separate transmission.</li>
        <li><b>Increased bandwidth usage:</b>When data is sent to many
          receivers individually in large networks it leads to the wastage
          of bandwidth.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5><b>Multicast Routing Protocol</b></h5>
      <p>Multicasting has one/more senders and multiple recipients
        participate in data transfer traffic. In multicasting traffic recline
        between the boundaries of unicast and broadcast. It server’s
        direct single copies of data streams and that are then simulated
        and routed to hosts that request it. IP multicast requires support
        of some other protocols such as Internet Group Management
        Protocol (IGMP), Multicast routing for its working. And also in
        Classful IP addressing Class D is reserved for multicast groups.</p>
        <h5><b>Advantage of Multicast</b></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Efficiency:</b>Compared with unicast communication, multicast
            helps in cutting down the number of data that is transmitted
            across the network since the data transmitted can be received
            by several persons; this is otherwise known as ‘Broadcast’.</li>
          <li><b>Scalability:</b>Multicast is suitable for application that requires
            distribution of information or sharing resource to many users
            that can elicit the flood the network principle to narrow scale
            thus making it opportune for scalable applications</li>
          <li><b>Cost-Effective:</b>Being a method that reduces the number of
            data set transmitted across the network, multicast helps in
            cutting down the overall expenditure on networks especially
            for the large scale broadcasts</li>
        </ul>
        <h5><b>Disadvantage of Multicast</b></h5>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Less reliable:</b>Multicast unfortunately can use connectionless
          protocols such as UDP unlike unicast thus making it incur in
          reliability as far as delivery is concerned.</li>
        <li><b>security Challenges:</b>Multicast communication is less secure
          as compared to unicast as the data is sent to multiple recipients
          thus posing a high risk of interception by unauthorized persons.</li>
        <li><b>Complex Implementation:</b>Whereas in multicast setting, up
          and managing a multicast network is a little bit more
          complicated than unicast since an appropriate routing protocols
          and settings are necessary.</li>
