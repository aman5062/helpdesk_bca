      <h4><b>Network</b></h4>
      <p>Network is a group of computers connected with each other through wires,optical fibres or optical links
        so that various devices can intract with each other through a network.
      </p>
      <h4><b>Networking</b></h4>
      <p>Computer networking refer to interconnected computing devices
        that can exchange data and share resources with each other.
      </p>
      <h3><b>Overview of Data Communication Networks</b></h3>
      <p>Communication is defined as a process in which more than computers
        transfers information, instructions to each other and for sharing resources.
      </p>
     <br><b>The effectiveness of any data communications system depends upon
     four fundamental characteristics.</b>
     <ol type="1">
      <li><b>Message-</b> message is a piece of information that is to be transmitted from one person to another.It would
      be transmitted from one person to another.It could be a text file, an audio file
      ,video file etc.</li>
      <li><b>Sender-</b> is simply a device that sends data message.It can be
        a computer,mobile,telephone,laptop,video camera or workstation etc.
        <br><b>Receiver-</b> is a device that receives messages.It can be a computer,
        telephone,mobile,workstation etc.

      </li>
      <li><b>Transmission Medium/Communication channels-</b> channels are the medium that
        connect two or more workstations. workstations can be connected by either wired media or
        wireless media.
      </li>
      <li><b>Set of Rules(Protocol)-</b> someone sends the data(The sender),it
        should be understandable to the receiver also otherwise it is meaningless.
        For example,sonali sends a message to chetan.If sonali writes in hindi
        and chetan cannot understand hindi,it is meaningless conversation.
      </li></ol>
      <img height="155"src="transmission.png" alt="communication diagram">
      <h4 class="ton">Types of data communication</h4>
      <p><b>The data communicationis divided into three types:-</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Simplex Communication-</b> is a one way Communication or we can say
          that unidirectional communication in which one device only
          receives and another device only send data and devices uses their
          entire capacity in transmission.For example,Iot,Entering data using a 
          keyboard, listening music using a speaker etc.
        </li>
        <li><b>Half Duplex Communication-</b>It is a two way communication,or we 
          can say that is a bidirectional communication in which both the devices can send and 
          receive data but not at the same time.For example walkie-Talkie,Intrent browsing.
        </li>
        <li><b>Full Duplex Communication-</b>It is a two way Communication or we can 
          say that it is bidirectional communication in which both the devices can send 
          and receive data at same time.For example, mobile phone,
          landlines etc.
        </li>
     </ol>
      <div>
        <h4><center><b>Protocol and standard in computer networks</b></center></h4>
        <p>Protocols and Standards are important in Computer networks.They are like the rule and guidelines
          that allow different devices and system to communicate and works together
          smoothly.Protocols define how data is sent,received,and processed,while standards ensure that
          various technologies are compatible with each other.
        </p></div>
        <h4><b><u>What is Protocol?</u></b></h4>
        <p>A protocol is a set of rules that determines how data is sent and received
          over s network.The protocol is just like a language that computers use to talk to each other, ensuring
          they understand that can respond to each other's message correctly.Protocol help to make sure that
          data moves smootly and securely between devices on a network.
        </p>
        <img height=90 src="protocol.png" alt="protocol">
         <p style="background-color: red;">In a above diagram, Protocols are shown as a set of rules.Communication between the sender and 
          Receiver is not possible without protocol.</p>
          <h4 ><center><u><b>Key Elements of Protocol</b></u></center></h4>
           <ul>
            <li><u><b>Timing:</b></u> Timing refers to the synchronization and coordination
              between devices while transferring the data. Timing ensures at what
              time data should be sent and how fast data can be sent. For example,
              If a sender sends 100 Mbps but the receiver can only handle 1 Mbps,
              the receiver will overflow and lose data. Timing ensures preventing
              of data loss, collisions, and other timing-related issues.</li>
              <li><u><b>Sequence Control:</b></u>Sequence control ensures the proper ordering of
                data packets. The main responsibility of sequence control is to
                acknowledge the data while it get received, and the retransmission of
                lost data. Through this mechanism, the data is delivered in correct order.</li>
               <li><u><b>Flow Control:</b></u>Flow Control regulates device data delivery. It limits
                the sender's data or asks the receiver if it's ready for more. Flow
                control prevents data congestion and loss.
                </li>
                <li><u><b>Error Control:</b></u>Error Control mechanisms detect and fix data
                  transmission faults. They include error detection codes, data resend,
                  and error recovery. Error control detects and corrects noise,
                  interference, and other problems to maintain data integrity.</li>
                 <li><u><b>Security:</b></u>Network security protects data confidentiality, integrity,
                  and authenticity. which includes encryption, authentication, access
                  control, and other security procedures. Network communication's
                  privacy and trustworthiness are protected by security standards.</li></ul>
                  <h3><b>Types of Protocol</b></h3>
                  <p>Network Layer Protocols</p>
                  <p>Transport Layer Protocols</p>
                  <p>Application Protocols</p>
                  <p>Wireless Protocols</p>
                  <p>Routing Protocols</p>
                  <p>Security Protocols</p>
                  <p>Internet Protocols</p>
               <h3><b>Important Protocols Used in Computer Network</b></h3>
                <p><b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):</b> Ensures data is sent and received accurately by
                breaking it into packets, sending them, and reassembling them at the destination.
                <br><b>IP (Internet Protocol):</b> Addresses and routes the packets to make sure they reach the right 
                destination.
               <br><b> HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure):</b> HTTP used for transferring 
                web pages on the internet.
               <br><b>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</b> Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
                It allows users to upload and download files.
                <br><b>DNS (Domain Name System): DNS:</b> DNS stands for Domain Name System. An IP address 
                is used to identify the connection of a host to the internet uniquely. But, people prefer to use the 
                names instead of addresses. Therefore, the system that maps the name to the address is known as 
                Domain Name System.
               <br><b>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):</b> Automatically assigns IP addresses 
                to devices on a network, ensuring each device has a unique address.
               <br><b>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):</b> Used for sending emails. It transfers emails 
                from a client to a server or between servers.
               <br><b>SSH (Secure Shell):</b> Provides a secure way to access and manage devices over a network. It 
                encrypts the data, making it safe from eavesdropping.
               <br><b>SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):</b> Used for managing and monitoring network devices like routers, switches, and servers. It collects and organizes
               information about these devices.</p>

                  <p><b>What Is The OSI Model</b></p>
                  The open system interconnection (OSI) model describes
                  seven layers that computer system use to communicate over a 
                  network. It was the first standard model for network comminication,
                  adopted by all major computer and
                  telecommunication companies in the early 1980s
                  The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler
                  TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely
                  used, as it helps visualize and communicate how networks
                  operate, and troubleshoot networking problems.
                  OSI was introduced in 1983 by representatives of the major
                  computer and telecom companies, and was adopted by ISO as an international standards In 1984.
                  <h3 class="osi">Introduction OSI</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It divides network architecture into seven layers
                      which, from top to bottom, are the Application,
                      Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data
                      Link, and Physical Layers. It is therefore often
                      referred to as the <b>OSI Seven Layer Model.</b></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3 class="osi">OSI History</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>In 1978, the International Standars
                        Organization (ISO) began to develop its
                        OSI framework architecture.</li>
                      <li>OSI has two major components: an
                        abstract model of networking, called the
                        Basic Reference Model or seven-layer

                     (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).</p>
                     <h6><b>Presentation Layer</b></h6>
                     <p>The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two
                        devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it is received correctly on
                        the other end. The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application
                        layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.
                        <br>Presentation layer protocol include MPEG and HTTP/HTML etc</p>
                        <h6><b>Session Layer</b></h6>
                        <p>The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between
                         devices. It is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and
                         functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication
                         ends. The session layer can also set checkpoints during a data transfer—if the
                         session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint</p>
                         <h6><b>Transport Layer</b></h6>
                         <p>The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into
                         “segments” on the transmitting end. It is responsible for reassembling the segments
                         on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer.
                         The transport layer carries out flow control, sending data at a rate that matches the
                         connection speed of the receiving device, and error control, checking if data was
                         received incorrectly and if not, requesting it again.</p>
                         <h6><b>Network Layer</b></h6>
                         <p>The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into
                          network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end. The other is
                          routing packets by discovering the best path across a physical network. The network
                          layer uses network addresses (typically Internet Protocol addresses) to route packets
                          to a destination node</p>
                          <h6><b>Data Link Layer</b></h6>
                          <p>The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two 
                             physically-connected nodes on a network. It breaks up packets into frames and 
                             sends them from source to destination. This layer is composed of two parts—
                             Logical Link Control (LLC), which identifies network protocols, performs error 
                             checking and synchronizes frames, and Media Access Control (MAC) which uses 
                             MAC addresses to connect devices and define permissions to transmit and receive 
                             data.</p>
                            <h6><b>Physical Layer</b></h6>
                            <p>The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection
                             between network nodes. It defines the connector, the electrical cable or wireless
                             technology connecting the devices, and is responsible for transmission of the raw
                             data, which is simply a series of 0s and 1s, while taking care of bit rate control.</p>
