     <h5><b>What is an Operating System?</h5></b>
      <p>A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.<br>
      An operating System is a collection of system programs that together control the operations of a computer
      system.</p>
      <p>Some examples of operating systems are UNIX, Mach, MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Windows/NT, Chicago, OS/2,
      MacOS, VMS, MVS, and VM.</p><br>
     <b>Operating system goals:</b>
     <ul>
      <li>Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.</li>
      <li>Make the computer system convenient to use.</li>
      <li>Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Computer System Components:</b>
      <ol type="1">
      <li><b>Hardware</b>-provides basic computing resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices).</li>
      <li><b>Operating system</b>-controls and coordinates the use of the hardware among the various application
      programs for the various users.</li>
      <li><b>Applications programs-</b>-Define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing.
      problems of the users (compilers, database systems, video games, business programs).</li>
      <li><b>users</b>(people, machines, other computers).
      Abstract View of System Components</li>

     <h5><b>Operating System Definitions</b></h5>
    <b>Resource allocator-</b>manages and allocates resources.<br>
    <b>Control program</b>-controls the execution of user programs and operations of I/O devices .<br>
    <b>Kernel-</b>The one program running at all times (all else being application programs).<br>
   <b>Components of OS:</b>-OS has two parts. (1)Kernel.(2)Shell.<br>
   <ul>
    <li>Kernel is an active part of an OS i.e., it is the part of OS running at all times. It is a programs which
    can interact with the hardware. Ex: Device driver, dll files, system files etc.</li>
    <li>Shell is called as the command interpreter. It is a set of programs used to interact with the application
    programs. It is responsible for execution of instructions given to OS (called commands).</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Operating systems can be explored from two viewpoints:</b> <p>the user and the system.</p>
    <b>User View:</b>-From the userâ€™s point view, the OS is designed for one user to monopolize its resources, to
    maximize the work that the user is performing and for ease of use.<br>
   <b>System View:</b> From the computer's point of view, an operating system is a control program that manages the
    execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is concerned with the
    operation and control of I/O devices.<br><br>

    
    <h5><b>function of operatings system:</h5></b>
    <p>An Operating System (OS) serves as the intermediary between computer hardware and users. Its primary functions include:</p>
   <ol type="1">
   <li><b>Resource Management:</b>-Allocates CPU, memory, and storage to various applications and processes.</li>
    <li><b>Process Management:</b>-Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.</li>
   <li><b>File System Management:</b>-Manages files, directories, and data storage.</li>
   
   <li><b>User Interface:</b>-Provides user interfaces such as command-line interfaces (CLI) or graphical user interfaces (GUI).</li>

     <li><b>Security and Access Control: </b>-Protects data and system resources through user authentication and permission controls.</li>
     <li><b>Device Management:</b>-Controls and manages hardware devices such as printers, disk drives, and keyboards.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5><b>Evolution of operating system:</b></h5>
      <b>Batch Processing System</b>
     <p>This type of OS accepts more than one jobs and these jobs are batched/       grouped together according to their
similar requirements. This is done by computer operator. Whenever the computer becomes available, the
batched jobs are sent for execution and gradually the output is sent back to the user.<br>
It allowed only one program at a time.
     This OS is responsible for scheduling the jobs according to priority and the resource required.</p>
     <b>Multiprogramming Operating System:</b>
     <p>This type of OS is used to execute more than one jobs simultaneously by a single processor. it increases CPU
     utilization by organizing jobs so that the CPU always has one job to execute.
     The concept of multiprogramming is described as follows:
     </ul>
     <li>All the jobs that enter the system are stored in the job pool( in disc). The operating system loads a set
     of jobs from job pool into main memory and begins to execute.</li>
    <li>During execution, the job may have to wait for some task, such as an I/O  operation, to complete. In
a multiprogramming system, the operating system simply switches to another job and executes.
     When that job needs to wait, the CPU is switched to another job, and so on.</li>
     <li>When the first job finishes waiting and it gets the CPU back.</li>
    <li>As long as at least one job needs to execute, the CPU is never idle.
    Multiprogramming operating systems use the mechanism of job scheduling and CPU scheduling.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <b>Time-Sharing/multitasking Operating Systems:</b>
    <p>Time sharing (or multitasking) OS is a logical extension of multiprogramming. It provides extra facilities such as:
    <li>Faster switching between multiple jobs to make processing faster.</li>
    <li>Allows multiple users to share computer system simultaneously.</li>
    <li>The users can interact with each job while it is running.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These systems use a concept of virtual memory for effective utilization of memory space. Hence, in this OS, no
    jobs are discarded. Each one is executed using virtual memory concept. It uses CPU scheduling, memory
    management, disc management and security management. Examples: CTSS, MULTICS, CAL, UNIX etc.</p>
