      <b>What is Environmental Awareness?</b>
      <p>Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences of these human decisions and help the planet’s health take a complete 180 degree in the other direction.</p><br>
      
  <b>Meaning of Multidisciplinary</b>
    <p>To understand the multidisciplinary nature of environmental studies, we must first comprehend the literal definition of the term multidisciplinary. The phrase is made up of two words: multi and disciplinary. To begin, we define the term disciplinary. Disciplined research in a certain subject is what the term “disciplinary” refers to. Multidisciplinary, on the other hand, refers to the combination of more than one discipline or topic of study. It defines multi-sect oral and multi-dimensional research in a variety of disciplines. For example, a multidisciplinary course of study is one in which you study a variety of disciplines such as Science, Social Science, Mathematics, English, and so on.</p>
      
      
    <b>How is Environmental Studies Multidisciplinary in Nature?</b>
     <p> Encompassing the elements of Physics, Chemistry, Medical Science, Agriculture, Geography, and Biology, Environmental Studies is a vast field of study. Not only restricted to environmental conservation and management of resources, but it also lays emphasis on understanding:</p>
  <ul>  
    <li>types of pollution and their harmful effects on living organisms.
    <li>Biodiversity, its types, and causes of degradation.</li>
    <li>desforestation and methods</li>
    <li>to increase forest cover.</li>
    <li>Desertification.</li>
    <li>Waste disposal and sewage treatment, etc.</li>
  </ul><br>
  <b>Multidisciplinary Nature of Environmental Studies Components.</b>
      Environmental studies are made up of several components. They are as follows:
      
  <ul>
      <li><b>Anthropology:</b>- It is the study of human traits, biological and the psychological well-being, communities and cultures, and the growth and evolution of humans. EVS is connected to anthropology since it studies humans and their environments throughout place and time.</li>
      <li><b>Biology:</b>- It is a field of science that focuses on the study of  living creatures. Their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, development, and evolution are all included. EVS is connected to biology since it is concerned with the natural environment of living creatures.
      <li><b>Chemistry:</b>- It is a field of science that examines chemicals and the components that makeup matter. Understanding natural occurrences in EVS necessitates knowledge of chemistry.</li>
      <li>Computers:</b>- As the world has progressed, computers have become a need for everyone. Computers are used by the Environmental Protection Agency to keep track of pollutants found in soil and water.</li>
      <li><b>Geology:</b>- It is the study of physical structures and substances found on Earth, as well as their history and the processes that they go through. EVS is also concerned with the study of the earth and environment.</li>
      <li><b>Economics:</b>- It is a field of study concerned with the production, consumption, and distribution of commodities and services. Various economic strategies have been established to preserve the environment from pollution, global warming, and climate change the evaluating and developing answers or cures for environmental concerns.</li>
      <li><b>Physics:</b>- It is a field of science that examines energy and matter in space and time, as well as their interactions. Physics is concerned with energy conservation, atmospheric modelling, and many environmental concerns.</li>
      <li><b>Sociology:</b>- It is the study of social life, change, social causes, and the social repercussions of human action. It also addresses the connection between contemporary society and the environment.</li>
      <li>Statistics:</b>- It is the study of quantitative data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. It is also used to evaluate data in order to find trends and recommend the optimal environmental growth.</li><br>
  </ul>
 <b>NEED FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS:</b>
      <p>Increasing population,and poverty have generated pressure on the natural resources and lead to a degradation of the environment. TO PREVENT THE ENVIRONMENT FROM FURTHER DEGRADATION, the Supreme Court has ordered and initiated environmental protection awareness through government and non-government agencies to take part in protecting our environment. Environmental pollution cannot prevented by laws alone. Public participation is equally important with regard to environmental protection. Environmental Education (EE) is a process of learning by giving an overall perspective of knowledge and awareness of the environment. It sensitizes the society about environmental issues and challenges interested individuals to develop skills and expertise thereby providing appropriate solutions. Climate change, loss of biodiversity, declining fisheries, ozone layer depletion, illegal trade of endangered species, destruction of habitats, land degradation, depleting ground water supplies, introduction of alien species, environmental pollution, solid waste disposal, storm water and sewage disposal pose a serious threat to ecosystems in forest, rural, urban and marine ecosystems. Both formal and informal education on the environment will give the interested individual the knowledge, values, skills and tools needed to face the environmental challenges on a local and global level</p><br>
      
      
      <b>The activities help in creating awareness among public are</b><br>
      
  <ul>
     <li>Join a group to study nature such as WWF-I or BNHS or any other organization</li>
     <li>Read newspaper articles and periodicals like Down to earth, WWF-I newsletter, BNHS, Hornbill, Sanctuary magazine.</li>
     <li>Discuss environmental issues with friends and relatives.</li>
     <li>Join local movements that support activities like saving trees in your locality, reducing use of plastics, going for nature treks, practicing 3 Rs i.e. reduce, reuse, & recycle.</li>
     <li>Practice and promote good civic sense and hygiene such as enforcing no spitting or tobacco chewing, no throwing garbage on the road and no urinating in public places.</li>
    <li>Take part in events organized on World Environment Day, Wildlife week et</li>
    <li>Visit a National park or sanctuary or spend time in whatever natural habitat you have near your home.</li><br>
  </ul>    
  World Environment Day : June 5th.<br>
   
  <b>Scope and Importance of Environmental Studies</b>
    <p>Environment is derived from the French word Environner, which mean encircle or surrounding. Environment is a complex of many variables, which surrounds man as well as the living organisms. Environmental studies describe the interrelationships among organisms, the environment and all the factors, which influence life on earth, including atmospheric conditions, food chains, the water cycle, etc. It is a basic science about our earth and its daily activities, and therefore, this science is important for one and all.</p><br>


  <b>Scope of environmental studies</b>
 <p>Environmental studies discipline has multiple and multilevel scopes. This study is important and necessary not only for children but also for everyone.</p>
 <br>

 <b>The scopes are summarized as follows:</b><br>

<ol type="1">
   <li>The study creates awareness among the people to know about various renewable and nonrenewable resources of the region. The endowment or potential, patterns of utilization and the balance of various resources available for future use in the state of a country are analysed in the study.</li>
<br>
   <li>It provides the knowledge about ecological systems and cause and effect relationships.</li>
<br>
   <li>It provides necessary information about biodiversity richness and the potential dangers to the species of plants, animals and microorganisms in the environment.</li>
<br>
   <li>The study enables one to understand the causes and consequences due to natural and main induced disasters (flood, earthquake, landslide, cyclones etc.,) and pollutions and measures to minimize the effects.</li>
<br>
   <li>It enables one to evaluate alternative responses to environmental issues before deciding an alternative course of action.</li>
<br>
  <li>The study enables environmentally literate citizens (by knowing the environmental acts, rights, rules, legislations, etc.) to make appropriate judgments and decisions for the protection and improvement of the earth.</li>
<br>
   <li>The study exposes the problems of over population, health, hygiene, etc. and the role of arts, science and technology in eliminating/ minimizing the evils from the society.</li><br>

   <li>The study tries to identify and develop appropriate and indigenous eco-friendly skills and technologies to various environmental issues.</li>
<br>
   <li>It teaches the citizens the need for sustainable utilization of resources as these resources are inherited from our ancestors to the younger generating without deteriorating their quality.</li>
<br>
   <li>The study enables theoretical knowledge into practice and the multiple uses of environment.</li>
<br>
</ol>
<b>Importance of environmental study:</b>
     <p>Environmental study is based upon a comprehensive view of various environmental systems. It aims to make the citizens competent to do scientific work and to find out practical solutions to current environmental problems. The citizens acquire the ability to analyze the environmental parameters like the aquatic, terrestrial and atmospheric systems and their interactions with the biosphere and astrosphere.</p>

    <b>Ecosystem</b>
    <img src="../assets/images/ecosystem.png" alt="ecosstem" id="img1" >
     <p>Ecosystem Definition “An ecosystem is defined as a community of life forms in concurrence with non-living components, interacting with each other.”</p>

    <b>What is an Ecosystem?</b>
        <p>The ecosystem is the structural and functional unit of ecology where the living organisms interact with each other and the surrounding environment. In other words, an ecosystem is a chain of interactions between organisms and their environment. The term “Ecosystem” was first coined by A.G.Tansley, an English botanist, in 1935. Read on to explore the structure, components, types and functions of the ecosystem in the ecosystem notes provided below.</p>
    
    
    <b>Types of Ecosystem</b>
        <p>An ecosystem can be as small as an oasis in a desert, or as big as an ocean, spanning thousands of miles.</p>
    
    <b>There are two types of ecosystem:</b>
   <ul> 
     <li>Terrestrial Ecosystem.</li>
     <li>Aquatic Ecosystem.</li>
     <li>Terrestrial Ecosystems.</li>
  </ul>  
        <p>Terrestrial ecosystems are exclusively land-based ecosystems. There are different types of terrestrial ecosystems distributed around various geological zones.</p><br>
    
    <b>They are as follows:</b>
    <ol>
     <li>Forest Ecosystems.</li>
     <li>Grassland Ecosystems.</li>
     <li>Tundra Ecosystems.</li>
     <li>Desert Ecosystem.</li>
     <li>Forest Ecosystem.</li>
     <li>Forest ecosystems.</li>
     <br>
  </ol>
    <b>forest ecosstem.</b>
        <p>A forest ecosystem consists of several plants, animals and microorganisms that live in coordination with the abiotic factors of the environment. Forests help in maintaining the temperature of the earth and are the major carbon sink.</p>
    
    
    <b>Grassland Ecosystem</b>
        <p>In a grassland ecosystem, the vegetation is dominated by grasses and herbs. Temperate grasslands, savanna grasslands are some of the examples of grassland ecosystems.</p><br>
    
    <b>Tundra Ecosystem</b>
        <p>Tundra ecosystems are devoid of trees and are found in cold climates or where rainfall is scarce. These are covered with snow for most of the year. The ecosystem in the Arctic or mountain tops is tundra type.</p><br>
    
    <b>Desert Ecosystem</b>
         <p>Deserts are found throughout the world. These are regions with very little rainfall. The days are hot and the nights are cold.</p><br>
    
    <b>Aquatic Ecosystem</b>
        <p>Aquatic ecosystems are ecosystems present in a body of water. These can be further divided into two types, namely:</p>
   <ol type="1"> 
      <li>Freshwater Ecosystem</li>
      <li>Marine Ecosystem</li>
   </ol>
    <ol type="1">
       <li><b>freshwater Ecosystem</b>-The freshwater ecosystem is an aquatic ecosystem  that includes lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and wetlands. These have no salt content in contrast with the marine ecosystem.</li>
       <li><b>Marine Ecosystem</b>-The marine ecosystem includes seas and oceans. These have a more substantial salt content and greater biodiversity in comparison to the freshwater ecosystem.</li>
    </ol>

    <b>Structure of the Ecosystem</b>
       <p>The structure of an ecosystem is characterized by the organization of both biotic and abiotic components. This includes the distribution of energy in our environment. It also includes the climatic conditions prevailing in that particular environment. The structure of an ecosystem can be split into two main components, namely:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Biotic Components.</li>
      <li>Abiotic Components.</li></ul>
      <p>The biotic and abiotic components are interrelated in an ecosystem. It is an open system where the energy and components can flow throughout the boundaries.</p>


    <p>Structure of Ecosystem highlighting the biotic and abiotic factors.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Biotic Components:-</b>Biotic components refer to all life in an ecosystem.  Based on nutrition, biotic components can be categorized into autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs (or decomposers).</li><br>

    <li><b>Producers:-</b>include all autotrophs such as plants. They are called autotrophs as they can produce food through the process of photosynthesis. Consequently, all other organisms higher up on the food chain rely on producers for food.</li><br>
    <li><b>Consumers</b>:-or heterotrophy are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. Consumers are further classified into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.</li><br>

      <li>Primary consumers are always herbivores that they rely on producers for food.</li><br>

      <li>Secondary consumersdepend on primary consumers for energy. They can either be a carnivore or an omnivore.</li><br>

      <li>Tertiary consumers are organisms that depend on secondary consumers for food.  Tertiary consumers can also be an omnivore.</li><br>

      <li><b>Quaternary consumers</b>-are present in some food chains. These organisms prey on tertiary consumers for energy. Furthermore, they are usually at the top of a food chain as they have no natural predators.</li><br>

      <li><b>Decomposers</b>-include saprophytes such as fungi and bacteria. They directly thrive on the dead and decaying organic matter.  Decomposers are essential for the ecosystem as they help in recycling nutrients to be reused by plants.</li><br>

      <li>Abiotic Components</li> </ul>
      <p>Abiotic components are the non-living component of an ecosystem.  It includes air, water, soil, minerals, sunlight, temperature, nutrients, wind, altitude, turbidity, etc.</p><br>

   <b>Functions of Ecosystem</b>
     <p>The functions of the ecosystem are as follows:</p>

      <li>It regulates the essential ecological processes, supports life systems and renders stability.</li>
      <li>It is also responsible for the cycling of nutrients between biotic and abiotic components.</li>
      <li>It maintains a balance among the various tropic levels in the ecosystem. It cycles the minerals through the biosphere.</li>
      <li>The abiotic components help in the synthesis of organic components that involves the exchange of energy.</li>

     <p>So the functional units of an ecosystem or functional components that work together in an ecosystem are:</p>


      <li><b>Productivity</b>:-It refers to the rate of biomass production.</li>
      <li><b>Energy flow</b>:-It is the sequential process through which energy flows from one tropic level to another. The energy captured from the sun flows from producers to consumers and then to decomposers and finally back to the environment.</li>
      <li><b>Decomposition</b>:-It is the process of breakdown of dead organic material. The top-soil is the major site for decomposition.</li>
      <li><b>Nutrient cycling</b>:-In an ecosystem nutrients are consumed and recycled back in various forms for the utilisation by various organisms.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <b>Important Ecological Concepts</b>
     <li><b>Food Chain</b></li>
      <p>The sun is the ultimate source of energy on earth. It provides the energy required for all plant life. The plants utilize this energy for the process of photosynthesis, which is used to synthesize their food. During this biological process, light energy is converted into chemical energy and is passed on through successive levels. The flow of energy from a producer, to a consumer and eventually, to an apex predator or a detritivore is called the food chain. Dead and decaying matter, along with organic debris, is broken down into its constituents by scavengers. The reducers then absorb these constituents. After gaining the energy, the reducers liberate molecules to the environment, which can be utilized again by the producers.</p>
     <img src="../assets/images/foodchain.png" alt="foodchain" id="img1">
     A classic example of a food chain in an ecosystem.

    <li><b>Ecological Pyramids</b></li>
       <p>An ecological pyramid is the graphical representation of the number, energy, and biomass of the successive trophic levels of an ecosystem. Charles Elton was the first ecologist to describe the ecological pyramid and its principals in 1927. The biomass, number, and energy of organisms ranging from the producer level to the consumer level are represented in the form of a pyramid; hence, it is known as the ecological pyramid. The base of the ecological pyramid comprises the producers, followed by primary and secondary consumers. The tertiary consumers hold the apex. In some food chains, the quaternary consumers are at the very apex of the food chain. The producers generally outnumber the primary consumers and similarly, the primary consumers outnumber the secondary consumers. And lastly, apex predators also follow the same trend as the other consumers; wherein, their numbers are considerably lower than the secondary consumers. For example, Grasshoppers feed on crops such as cotton and wheat, which are plentiful. These grasshoppers are then preyed upon by common mice, which are comparatively less in number. The mice are preyed upon by snakes such as cobras. Snakes are ultimately preyed on by apex predators such as the brown snake eagle.</p>
    
      
      <li><b>Food Web</b></li>
        <p>Food web is a network of interconnected food chains. It comprises all the food chains within a single ecosystem. It helps in understanding that plants lay the foundation of all the food chains. In a marine environment, phytoplankton forms the primary producer.</p>
